			"description": "The creation of NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a growing practice in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. NFTs make it possible to represent unique digital assets such as works of art, videos, music, video games, etc. Each NFT has a unique code written on the blockchain, which guarantees the authenticity and ownership of the asset represented."

		"auction": {
			"title": "Auction",
			"description": "NFT auctions are a popular way to buy and sell unique and collectible NFTs. Auctions work like traditional auctions, where buyers bid on an NFT, and the highest bid wins the auction. NFT auctions can last from a few hours to several days, and sellers often have the option of setting a minimum reserve price for their NFT."

			"title": "What is an NFT",
			"description_1": "NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. Let's start with the basics: what does non-fungible mean? The adjective 'fungible' is an economic term that refers to a good or asset that can be exchanged for another good or asset of the same value. For example, a one-dollar bill is fungible because it can easily be exchanged for another one-dollar bill of equal value.",
			"description_2": "A 'non-fungible' item cannot be exchanged for something of equal value. A piece of land is non-fungible, as each piece of land has its own unique characteristics, and finding another piece of land with strictly identical value is difficult, if not impossible. Art is another example of a non-fungible asset, as its value is highly subjective. This is where NFTs come in.",
			"description_3": "An NFT guarantees exclusive ownership of a digital asset (e.g., artwork, an in-game purchase, or even a tweet!). You can purchase an NFT at a certain price, but its non-fungible nature allows its market value to fluctuate."
